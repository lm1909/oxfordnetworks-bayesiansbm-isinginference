## Abstract
Inferring modular structure via block modeling and its direct generalisation, stochastic block modeling, is among the most prominent approaches to the paradigmatic question of the inference of modular structure in network science. Another central problem in the theory of complex networks is the inference of networks from empirical data, where again the inference from observed network dynamics, for example from Ising-like models, is especially prominent. Bayesian stochastic blockmodelling forms a flexible framework, that provides a method to jointly solve both inference problems, which has been shown to be more effective than a separated approach (1). We review the general Bayesian stochastic blockmodeling framework, its generalisation to joint blockmodelling and network inference and the concrete realisation for an Ising-like 3-Potts model dynamic process. Furthermore we apply the method to a dataset of roll call votes of the German parliament Bundestag and discuss the results.
